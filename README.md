# Envy Rebooter
Envy Rebooter is a open source reverse enginnering project in Python to replicate Restarter v3, a popular Discord bot.
## How to self host Envy Rebooter
**You will need Python 3.8 or later to use Envy Rebooter. Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/).**

Once you have Python installed, you will need to install **discord.py**. You can do it by running the following:
```bash
pip install discord.py
```
Keep in mind that you will need superuser priveleges to run **pip** so put sudo/doas or whatever your favorite thing is to run **pip**.

Now run the following to clone the latest version of our repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/envyjs/rebooter.git && cd rebooter
```
